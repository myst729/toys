# Conway's Game of Life

> _This is not funny. It's about life and death..._

**About the game**

+ The [Game of Life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life), also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician [John Horton Conway](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Horton_Conway) in 1970.
+ The game is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input.
+ One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves.

**Rules of the game**

+ Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by under-population.
+ Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
+ Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overcrowding.
+ Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
